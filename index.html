            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>A career in animation could be one of the best decisions in a person’s life or it could be the worst.
                It is one of the most consumed media in modern entertainment with the advancement of television and
                the internet.
                Kids growing up in today’s age are also wishing to become animators in the future. Many young and
                impressionable people are looking to find ways to make a living doing animation.
                It is also fairly easy to get into creating animations and learning. The industry also provides a
                plethora of job positions and opportunities. However, the industry itself is also plagued with its
                own negatives.
                Overwork, low pay, and high competition may overshadow the positives that comes with this choice of
                career.</p>

                    animation is
                    affordable to develop. Due to its
                    simplicity, the budget needed to create 2D animations is lower than its oppositions. Animators have
                    found ways to cut corners on having to draw many frames per second such as animating on 2s, which
                    allows them to significantly cut down the required number of frames needed. They can also animate on
                    3s and 4s. This is especially useful when animating slower scenes such as still frame scenes when
                    characters are talking as they do not require constant movement. This is something that is difficult
                    to pull off with 3D. This results in a higher efficiency by reducing the amount of workload needed
                    for animators to draw. Fewer frames to draw means less budget to expend into unnecessary frames that
                    would make little difference in the long run. With the advancements of technology and 2D animation
                    becoming digital, software developers are also </article>
