      <h3>Clip Studio Paint</h3>
      <img src="images/thumbnail_1.png"><br>
      <p>Clip Studio Paint is the main program I use to create everything that I do.Formerly known as Manga Studio in
        North America. Clip Studio Paint is a software application developed by a
        Japanese graphic software company, Celsys and was initially released 22
        years ago in 2001. The application is split between two editions. The Pro version and the EX version. I use the
        EX version as I also create multi page projects. I also create animations well above 24 frames. Clip Studio
        Paint is available in Windows,Mac,and Linux</p>

      <h3>Asesprite</h3><img src="images/thumbnail_2.png">
      <p>Another Program I use is Asesprite. Asesprite is a program designed to primarily create animated sprites. It
        also can be used just for pixel art. The program consists of features
        to make it easier to animate pixel art. </p><br>
      <ul>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <li>Create sprites with separate layers and frames.</li>
        <li>RGBA or indexed color modes.</li>
        <li>Save in GIF or image sequences(PNG).</li>
        <li>Animation timeline with freedom to manipulate frames and layers in different keyframes and frames.</li>
        <li>Exporting/Importing Sprite Sheets.</li>
        <li>A command line interface to automate conversion and sprite sheets generation.</li>
        <li>Updates for the whole v1.x series up to v1.9.</li>
      </ul> <br>
      <p>The app itself goes for $19.99 on Steam and its website. However, it is also available for free as its source
        code is freely available to be downloaded from github for those who are
        willing to build the files themselves. The only thing you'll miss from not buying it is not being able to get
        automated updates. Asesprite is availabe in Windows, Mac, and Linux OS.
