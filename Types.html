            <h1>2D Animation</h1>
            <p>This differs in the style of the film, but 2D animation is affordable to develop. Due to its
                simplicity, the budget needed to create 2D animations is lower than its oppositions. Animators have
                found ways to cut corners on having to draw many frames per second such as animating on 2s, which
                allows them to significantly cut down the required number of frames needed. They can also animate on
                3s and 4s. This is especially useful when animating slower scenes such as still frame scenes when
                characters are talking as they do not require constant movement. This is something that is difficult
                to pull off with 3D. This results in a higher efficiency by reducing the amount of workload needed
                for animators to draw. Fewer frames to draw means less budget to expend into unnecessary frames that
                would make little difference in the long run. With the advancements of technology and 2D animation
                becoming digital, software developers are also </p>
